# C Programs Structure
*This class is based on [Professor Zolt√°n's Materia](http://gsd.web.elte.hu/lectures/c-en/c-lecture-2/) and [GeeksForGeeks Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)*

## Last Class

During the last lecture we learned:
- How the C software is structured
- How do make a loop
- How to use variables
- How to compile our software
- How to execute our software

## Warm up

Let's have a short warm up and play,

First let's learn a new function...

modulo(modulus): the remainder of an euclidian division e.g.: 10 mod 2 = 0, 3 mod 2 =1.

How to do it in C:

    // module of 3 divided by 2:
    3 % 2

Now that you know how to operate that, make a C program (from scratch, DO NOT COPY AND PASTE ANYTHING) that will count from 1 to 100 and every time the number is a divider of 3 you should replace the number with "pi".

example:

    1
    2
    pi
    4
    5
    pi
