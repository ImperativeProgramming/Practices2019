## Binary Tree Search

In order to exercise our knowledge on references we will today implement a binary search tree. Let's first understand the concept of it.

In summary, copied and pasted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree)

A Binary Search Tree is a node-based data structure where each node contains a key and two subtrees, the left and right. For all nodes, the left subtree's key must be less than the node's key, and the right subtree's key must be greater than the node's key. These subtrees must all qualify as binary search trees.

The Binary tree you are building is to an hypothetic situation where you would like to store people with different ages (23, 10, 20, 21...). If you add someone repeating age, you should return a message to your user (and not add).

Your first task is to divide this problem into small steps, have in mind the following things:

* You know how to make a linked list;
* You know how to make a structure;
* You know how the Binary trees work.
