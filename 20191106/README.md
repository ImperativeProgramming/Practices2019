*This class is based on  [GeeksForGeeks Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-strings-using-bubble-sort-2/)*

## Before Starting
- Discussion on the assignment
- Hey Siri, who's gonna show the home works?

### TASKS

#### T1
Create an Array of Strings with the following names:
Josh
Patrick
Maria
Carlos
Ali
Ia

Now using what you've learned in the previous classes and the today's functions, print them out in alphabetical order.

#### T2
- Create a structure with 3 names (you can call it name1, name2...)
- Create a function that takes a structure (or a pointer to the structure) as parameter and sorts the names in alphabetical order

#### T3
Based on what we learned today, sort the previous class exercise by name.
