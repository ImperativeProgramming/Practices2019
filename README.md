## Evaluation Method
* Only final grade can be rounded up or down
  * The judgement of rounding is done by the lecturers based in presence, grades and final exam performance.
* If there is no rule for the calculation, simple average calculation will take place;


### Classes Exercises (2 points / 40%)
The class exercises will be pondered by the lecturers according to the dificulty/effort required to accomplish and will worth 2 points of the final grade.

**NOTE:** Even though the exercises worth 2 points, all students are still required to pass the final exam regardless exercise grades.

### Final exam (3 points / 60%)
The final exam has a grade from 1 (fail) to 5(excellent), passing the final exam is unnegotiable necessary to pass this course.

The final exam will be performed under controlled and monitored environment during the exam period.

Multiple exams opportunities will be announced, students are allowed to retake it, in tis case, the higher one is the valid one (AKA no-risk retake).

### Extra points
Extra points from classes are possible only for the exercises' grade, (e.g. pull requests may be subject to extra points).


## Absences

* Lab Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide each case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you can have 3 absences.

## No Babysitting

You are the responsible for your exercises and your learning, if that's not happening, you are the one who needs to seek for help


## Copies, plagiarism and similars
Cheating exams or copying other's people work without the appropriate reference will fail you. For such cases there is no second exam chance, no retake, no whatever. In case of a copied exam, both students fail.

Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood (e.g. fake documents)  or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction in the format of the university regulations.
