# First Class

Today's class is inspired in Professor Zoltán Porkoláb material also available [HERE](http://gsd.web.elte.hu/lectures/c-en/c-lecture-1/). We also will have lots of things coming from GeeksForGeeks tutorials, feel free to go further looking their content [HERE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)

We won't have IDEs during this course, the reason is simple, if you can program without the IDE you can program with the IDE, the other way around isn't true.
